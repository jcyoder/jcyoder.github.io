				<h1>About Me...</h1>
				<p>
					Hello! Welcome to my portfolio page.  I am a Colorado native, born in Denver and raised in Arvada. 
                    I came to Northern Colorado in 1990 and earned a Bachelor's in mathematics with an emphasis 
                    in computer science. I have spent my entire career working on software development teams in a variety of roles. 
                    Most recently, I have worked in product/program management and as a Scrum Master. 
                    I would like to return to a more technical role and transition into Web development. 
                    WebLab - A Web Development Boot Camp, FRCC has given me an exciting opportunity to do just that.
