				<h1>About Me...</h1>
				<p>
					Hello!  I am a Colorado native who grew up in Arvada.  I came to Northern Colorado in 1990 
					and received a Bachelors in Mathematics with an Emphasis in Computer Science.  
					I have spent my entire career working on software development teams in a variety of different
					roles. In the later part of my career, I spent my time in Product/Program Management and Scrum Master
					positions. Since I miss being in a more technical role, I would like to transition my career into Web development.  WebLab - A Web Development Boot Camp, 
					FRCC has given me this exciting opportunity to do just that!
